# MNIST_NN_Learning

## Disclosure:
All Credits to Samson Zhang. I am following their tutorial as to how to build a simple neural network from scratch and using their code: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&amp;ab_channel=SamsonZhang]. Here is a link to their Kaggle repo: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras/notebook]


## Project Description:

Following along how to build a NN from scratch using the MNIST data set [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data]

## Key takeaways:

- Building a simple 2 layer Neural Network
- Gaining familiarity with numpy arrays and how to manipulate data
